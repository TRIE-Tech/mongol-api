# Project Contribution Guidelines

## How to Contribute

Welcome to our project! If you're eager to make a valuable contribution, please take a moment to review our contribution guidelines. Following these steps will ensure a smooth and effective collaboration.

### Contribution Guidelines

1. **Create a Task on the Project Kanban Board**

   Your journey begins with the creation of a task on our project's Kanban board. This task should be comprehensive, with subtasks if necessary. Our Kanban board is the nerve center for managing project tasks.

2. **Create a Branch for the Issue**

   Once your task is logged on the Kanban board, create a dedicated branch tailored to that issue. Choose a branch name that succinctly reflects the issue or feature you're tackling.

   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

3. **Work on the Issue**

    With your branch in place, dive into the issue or feature. It's essential to uphold coding standards and adhere to best practices while working.

4. **Create a Pull Request**

    When you've completed your work on the issue, craft a pull request (PR) with the following components:

    - **What Have You Implemented?** Describe the changes or features you've implemented in detail. This section should provide a clear understanding of your contribution.

    - **Step-by-Step Testing Guide:** Furnish a comprehensive guide on how to test the feature or implementation. This guide should be easily followed and cover all pertinent testing scenarios.

    - **Preview Link:** Embed a preview link in your pull request to enable reviewers and contributors to validate your changes. Accessibility is key.

5. **Review and Approval**

    Your pull request will go through a thorough review by the project team. Once it gets approved, the project lead will merge it into the base code. If the review process necessitates changes or further enhancements, kindly address them promptly.
    
    By adhering to these contribution guidelines, you will play a pivotal role in maintaining the project's quality and ensuring a streamlined and efficient contribution process.
